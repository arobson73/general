`apt-get update` updates your current package metadata from the APT servers.
`apt-get upgrade` upgrades your installed packages, based on information in the metadata,
but keeps your Ubuntu and kernel versions the same. `apt-get dist-upgrade` upgrades to new
kernel versions and you'll want to reboot afterwards.
